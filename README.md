This is task 1 of Oasis Infobyte | Data Science Domain.

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

 ðŸŒ»IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATIONðŸŒº
 
Dive into a hands-on machine learning project where we classify Iris flower species using Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree algorithms. Join me in uncovering the fascinating world of data analysis and predictive modeling!

Project Highlights:

â€¢Utilized the classic Iris dataset with 150 samples of three Iris species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).
â€¢Applied techniques including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Label Encoding, and Correlation Matrix.
â€¢Implemented and compared three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree.
â€¢Evaluated model performance using accuracy on test data.

Steps Involved:

â€¢Load the Iris dataset, display the first few rows, generate descriptive statistics and data type information, and count samples for each Iris species.
â€¢Check for and handle any null values in the dataset.
â€¢Visualize data distributions using histograms for each feature and create scatter plots to explore relationships between feature pairs, color-coded by species.
â€¢Convert categorical species labels into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
â€¢Generate a correlation matrix and visualize it with a heatmap to understand feature relationships.
â€¢Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree models, comparing their accuracy.

Key Takeaway:

ðŸ”‘Through this project, I explored the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning classification techniques. By comparing the performance of Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree algorithms, I gained valuable insights into model selection and evaluation. This hands-on experience has strengthened my understanding of the machine learning workflow and its practical applications.ðŸ’¡
